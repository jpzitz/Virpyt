# Virpyt
This project’s purpose is to allow a table to be described as a Python data structure that can be codified into a read-able API.  As an example, it uses openpyxl to process tables in Excel format.
One feature of the API is that users can move around columns without impacting programs written using Virpyt.
Requires installation of openpyxl: https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
